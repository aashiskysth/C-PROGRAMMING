# C-PROGRAMMING
My learning in C-programming.
>>>Introduction to C Programming


C is a powerful, high-performance, and general-purpose programming language developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It was specifically designed for system-level programming and to develop the UNIX operating system, but its simplicity, efficiency, and portability quickly made it one of the most widely used programming languages of all time.

C provides low-level memory access, minimal runtime overhead, and fine control over system resources, which makes it ideal for writing operating systems, embedded systems, compilers, and performance-critical applications.

>>>Key Features:


Structured Language: Supports modular programming using functions.

Portability: Code written in C can run on different machines with minimal or no modification.

Efficiency: Close to hardware; allows fine-tuned performance.

Rich Library Support: Standard libraries offer a wide range of functions.

Foundation of Modern Languages: C influenced C++, Java, C#, Python, and many others.

>>>Why Learn C?
It's the foundation of modern computing.

Builds a strong understanding of how software interacts with hardware.

Great for learning core programming concepts: data types, control structures, memory management, pointers, etc.
